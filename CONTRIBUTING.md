- Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and make sure it is enabled by running
  `pre-commit install` in the repository checkout.

## Quality Assurance & Scripts

The following scripts are available via `yarn` (see `package.json`):

- `yarn qa`: Run all QA checks (type checking, linting, spelling, formatting).
- `yarn check-formatting`: Check code formatting.
- `yarn format`: Auto-format code.
- `yarn check-spelling`: Run spell checker.
- `yarn test`: Run unit tests with Vitest.

The above all need to pass for any code changes to be accepted.
